Wanted to just write stuff down so I don't forget
should I be concerned about running a loop tiwce, you created the words loop

   words = [ x.strip() for x in open("dictionary.txt", "r") if len(x.strip()) == 7 ]
 
 then the
 
  for x in words loop
 
 doesnt this slown down the code runnng a loop twice or am I becoming too time concerned versus readability  
 
 is it better to try and write as muny functions/operations in a single line of code
 
 is a list hask key quicker or slower than a string?
